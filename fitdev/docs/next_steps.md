# FitDev.io - Next Development Steps

This document outlines the planned future development for the FitDev.io virtual software development organization project.

## Core Framework Enhancements

### 1. Agent Intelligence Enhancement
- **LLM Integration**: Connect agents to large language models for more intelligent task execution
- **Browser Capabilities**: Add web browsing capability for agents to research and gather information
- **Memory Persistence**: Implement agent memory to retain context across tasks and cycles

### 2. Task Management Improvements
- **Task Dependencies**: Enhance the dependency system with more sophisticated task scheduling
- **Subtask Generation**: Allow agents to automatically generate subtasks from main tasks
- **Task Feedback Loop**: Improve how task results inform future task planning

### 3. Performance Evaluation System
- **Objective Metrics**: Implement quantifiable metrics for measuring agent performance
- **Peer Review System**: Allow agents to review each other's work beyond just critics
- **Trend Analysis**: Track performance over time to identify improvement or decline

## Feature Development

### 1. Project Simulation
- **Project Templates**: Create predefined project templates (web app, mobile app, etc.)
- **Timeline Simulation**: Add time-based constraints and deadlines to projects
- **Resource Constraints**: Implement resource limitations that affect project execution

### 2. Collaboration Mechanics
- **Agent Communication**: Enable direct communication between agents
- **Team Formation**: Allow dynamic team creation for specific projects
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Implement knowledge transfer between agents

### 3. Visualization and Reporting
- **Dashboard**: Create a visual dashboard to monitor organization performance
- **Progress Reports**: Generate detailed reports on project progress
- **Agent Growth**: Visualize how agents improve over time

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Architecture
- **Microservices Architecture**: Refactor into a more modular microservices structure
- **API Layer**: Create a formal API for interacting with the organization
- **Event System**: Implement an event-driven architecture for better decoupling

### 2. Storage and Persistence
- **Database Integration**: Move from in-memory to persistent database storage
- **Project History**: Maintain historical data across multiple runs
- **Data Export/Import**: Allow exporting and importing organization state

### 3. Testing and Documentation
- **Test Suite Expansion**: Create more comprehensive automated tests
- **Documentation Generation**: Automated documentation from code and agent activities
- **Example Projects**: Create example projects that demonstrate the system's capabilities

## Integration Opportunities

### 1. External Tools
- **Version Control Integration**: Connect with Git for code management
- **Issue Tracker Integration**: Connect with issue trackers like JIRA
- **CI/CD Integration**: Link with CI/CD pipelines for real deployments

### 2. Interfaces
- **Web Interface**: Create a web-based UI for interacting with the organization
- **CLI Improvements**: Enhance the command-line interface with more options
- **API Clients**: Build client libraries for different programming languages

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Implement browser capability for agents to gather information
2. Connect agents to LLMs for more intelligent task execution
3. Enhance task execution logic with more realistic work simulation
4. Create project templates for common software development scenarios
5. Add metrics collection and visualization

## Timeline

- **Phase 1 (1-2 months)**: LLM integration and browser capabilities
- **Phase 2 (2-3 months)**: Task management improvements and project templates
- **Phase 3 (3-6 months)**: Collaboration mechanics and visualization
- **Phase 4 (6+ months)**: External integrations and advanced features
